    <h1>The real Tartiflette</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Tartiflette is a French comfort dish hailing from the Savoie region, composed of layers of tender sliced potatoes, sautéed onions, crispy lardons, and creamy Reblochon cheese. Baked to golden perfection, it offers a delightful harmony of textures and flavors, with the cheese forming a gooey and indulgent topping that perfectly complements the hearty combination of ingredients. This dish captures the essence of Alpine cuisine and is a beloved choice for warm and satisfying meals, often paired with a fresh salad and a glass of wine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>7 onions</li>
        <li>2 reblochon (we always do 2 and half ;))</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>2.5kg of potatoes</li>
        <li>300ml of creme fraiche</li>
        <li>500 grams of lardons</li>
        <li>200ml of white wine from Savoie</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the potatoes in water for 20 minutes, then peel them and cut them into slices.</li>
    <li>Chop the onions and sauté them in a little butter.</li>
    <li>Add the smoked lardons and also leave to brown over a fairly low heat (about ten minutes), stirring regularly.</li>
    <li>Prepare a baking dish (I use a round terracotta dish 40 cm in diameter, 10 cm high). Generously rub the bottom of the dish with a clove of garlic.</li>
    <li>Arrange the dish in three layers: cover the bottom of the dish with half the potatoes, then add the onion and bacon mixture, finally add the rest of the potatoes on top.</li>
    <li>Pour over the white wine and the creme fraiche. Pepper (quite copiously) and salt (lightly).</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 190°C (thermostat 6-7).</li>
    <li>Scrape the reblochons, cut them in half lengthwise and place them (crust side up) on top of the potatoes.</li>
    <li>Bake for about 20 minutes (I put the oven on "fan-assisted" + grill). When serving (in the baking dish), you can sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. This unique dish is eaten (that's the right word!) accompanied by the wine used for the recipe.</li>
    <li>Bon Appétit</li>
